# GETTING STARTED

## Introduction

This document serves multiple purposes. As an onboarding guide for new research assistants, its aim is to introduce the research tools I use and how to get started with these tools. I also try to describe a standard for good research habits. As a reference manual, this document serves as a resource and first line of defense for when questions arise.

### How To Use This Manual

1. Read the Table of Contents to learn what’s covered in the handbook and where to find it.
2. Read the Setup Guide and follow the instructions in first things first.
   - Read Gentzkow & Shapiro, [Code and Data for the Social Sciences](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) [Download](pdf/CodeAndData.pdf)
   - Complete the steps to set up each of the tools.
3. In the future, when you have questions, start by looking back here for answers.

### Commandments for Productive Coding

Nobody really sticks to these fully, but everyone should be striving to adhere to the following three principles. The more you stick to them, the more productive and efficient we can be.

1. **Don’t Repeat Yourself:** Put your work in a place where you can find it later. Turn repetitive tasks into functions and groups of repetitive tasks into modules. Write code that writes code.
2. **Plan to Rewrite:** Rewriting is a fact of life. Fix “broken windows” now. Expect to rewrite and reorganize code as projects evolve. Don’t plan to “come back and tidy that up later”, do it now before moving on to something else.
3. **Write Code that Others Can Read and Use:** For all code you write, adhere to a consistent set of readability rules. Add in more comments than you think are necessary; others (including your future self) will thank you!

##  Setup Guide

### First Things First

1. Do some of the recommended readings in chapter 20, especially Read Gentzkow & Shapiro, [Code and Data for the Social Sciences](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) [PDF](pdf/CodeAndData.pdf). Pay close attention to their guidelines regarding code style, documentation, version control, and task management.
